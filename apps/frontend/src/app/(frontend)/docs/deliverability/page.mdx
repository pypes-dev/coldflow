# Domain Deliverability Check

The Domain Deliverability Check tool helps you verify your domain's email authentication configuration. It checks your SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and MX records to ensure your emails reach the inbox.

## Why Email Authentication Matters

Email authentication is critical for:

- **Deliverability**: Emails from authenticated domains are less likely to be marked as spam
- **Security**: Protects your domain from being spoofed by bad actors
- **Reputation**: Builds trust with email providers and recipients
- **Compliance**: Many B2B recipients require proper authentication

Without proper configuration, your emails may be rejected, quarantined, or marked as spam.

## Using the Tool

1. Navigate to [/deliverability](/deliverability)
2. Enter your domain (e.g., `example.com`)
3. Click "Check Domain"
4. Review the results and recommendations

The tool will check:

- **SPF Records**: Sender Policy Framework authentication
- **DKIM Records**: DomainKeys Identified Mail signatures
- **DMARC Records**: Domain-based Message Authentication policies
- **MX Records**: Mail server configuration

## Understanding the Results

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF records specify which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain.

**Example SPF Record:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

**Common Issues:**

- **Missing SPF record**: Add a TXT record to your DNS with your SPF configuration
- **Too many DNS lookups**: SPF has a limit of 10 DNS lookups. Consolidate includes or use IP ranges
- **No fail policy**: End your SPF record with `~all` (soft fail) or `-all` (hard fail)

**How to Fix:**

Add a TXT record to your domain's DNS:

```
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.yourprovider.com ~all
```

Replace `_spf.yourprovider.com` with your email provider's SPF include.

**✅ Common Providers & Their SPF Includes**

Here are the correct values depending on who sends your email:

| Email Service | SPF Include |
|--------------|-------------|
| Google Workspace / Gmail | `include:_spf.google.com` |
| Microsoft 365 / Outlook | `include:spf.protection.outlook.com` |
| Namecheap Email Hosting (Private Email) | `include:spf.privateemail.com` |
| Zoho Mail | `include:zoho.com` |
| SendGrid | `include:sendgrid.net` |
| Mailgun | `include:mailgun.org` |
| AWS SES | `include:amazonses.com` |
| Brevo (Sendinblue) | `include:spf.brevo.com` |
| Postmark | `include:spf.mtasv.net` |
| Mailchimp | `include:servers.mcsv.net` |

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails, proving they haven't been tampered with.

**How DKIM Works:**

1. Your email server adds a cryptographic signature to outgoing emails
2. The public key is published in your DNS records
3. Receiving servers verify the signature using the public key

**Common Issues:**

- **No DKIM record**: Configure DKIM through your email service provider
- **Invalid selector**: Ensure you're using the correct DKIM selector
- **Key rotation needed**: Rotate DKIM keys periodically for security

**How to Fix:**

1. Generate a DKIM key pair through your email provider
2. Add the public key to your DNS as a TXT record
3. Enable DKIM signing in your email service

**Example DKIM Record:**

```
Type: TXT
Host: default._domainkey
Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQ...
```

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to tell receiving servers what to do with emails that fail authentication.

**Example DMARC Record:**

```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc@example.com; pct=100
```

**DMARC Policies:**

- `p=none`: Monitor mode - collect reports but don't take action
- `p=quarantine`: Quarantine suspicious emails
- `p=reject`: Reject emails that fail authentication

**Common Issues:**

- **No DMARC record**: Add a DMARC record to monitor email authentication
- **Policy set to "none"**: Start with "none" to monitor, then move to "quarantine" or "reject"
- **No reporting addresses**: Add `rua=` for aggregate reports and `ruf=` for forensic reports

**How to Fix:**

Add a TXT record to your DNS:

```
Type: TXT
Host: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com; pct=100
```

**DMARC Implementation Strategy:**

1. Start with `p=none` to monitor without affecting delivery
2. Review DMARC reports for 2-4 weeks
3. Identify legitimate sending sources and update SPF/DKIM
4. Gradually increase to `p=quarantine` then `p=reject`

### MX Records

MX records specify which mail servers handle email for your domain.

**Example MX Records:**

```
10 mail.example.com
20 backup-mail.example.com
```

**Common Issues:**

- **No MX records**: Your domain cannot receive email
- **Single MX record**: No redundancy if primary server fails
- **Incorrect priority**: Lower numbers have higher priority

## Best Practices

### 1. Warm Up Your Domain

When sending from a new domain or IP:

- Start with low volumes (10-20 emails/day)
- Gradually increase over 2-4 weeks
- Target engaged recipients first
- Monitor bounce and spam complaint rates

### 2. Maintain List Hygiene

- Remove hard bounces immediately
- Suppress unengaged contacts after 90-180 days
- Validate email addresses before importing
- Use double opt-in for new subscribers

### 3. Monitor Your Metrics

Track these key metrics:

- **Bounce Rate**: Should be < 2%
- **Spam Complaint Rate**: Should be < 0.1%
- **Open Rate**: Varies by industry (15-25% typical)
- **Unsubscribe Rate**: Should be < 0.5%

### 4. Use Dedicated IPs

For high-volume sending (100k+ emails/month):

- Use dedicated IP addresses
- Maintain consistent sending patterns
- Keep IP reputation separate from shared pools
- Warm up new IPs properly

### 5. Segment Your Sending

- Separate transactional and marketing emails
- Use different subdomains for different email types
- Example: `marketing.example.com` vs `transactional.example.com`

## Testing Your Configuration

After making changes:

1. Use the [Deliverability Check tool](/deliverability)
2. Send test emails to Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo
3. Check spam folders and email headers
4. Use tools like [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com/) for additional validation

## Common Email Provider Requirements

### Gmail

- Requires SPF or DKIM (both recommended)
- DMARC strongly recommended for bulk sending
- Rate limit: ~2,000 emails/day for free accounts

### Microsoft (Outlook, Hotmail)

- Requires SPF and DKIM
- DMARC recommended
- Sign up for [SNDS](https://postmaster.live.com/snds/) to monitor reputation

### Yahoo

- Requires DMARC with `p=reject` or `p=quarantine` for bulk senders
- SPF and DKIM required
- Very strict on authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Going to Spam

1. Check SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configuration
2. Review email content for spam triggers
3. Ensure proper list hygiene
4. Check if your IP/domain is blocklisted
5. Improve engagement rates

### High Bounce Rates

1. Validate email addresses before sending
2. Remove hard bounces immediately
3. Check for typos in email addresses
4. Verify MX records are correct

### Authentication Failures

1. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS changes to propagate
2. Check DNS records with multiple tools
3. Verify DKIM selector matches configuration
4. Ensure SPF includes all sending sources

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Sending Domains

Use subdomains for different email types:

```
transactional.example.com  � SPF, DKIM, DMARC
marketing.example.com      � SPF, DKIM, DMARC
support.example.com        � SPF, DKIM, DMARC
```

### BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)

After configuring DMARC with `p=quarantine` or `p=reject`:

1. Create an SVG logo (max 32KB)
2. Host on HTTPS endpoint
3. Add BIMI DNS record
4. Register VMC (Verified Mark Certificate) for Gmail

**Example BIMI Record:**

```
Type: TXT
Host: default._bimi
Value: v=BIMI1; l=https://example.com/logo.svg; a=https://example.com/vmc.pem
```
